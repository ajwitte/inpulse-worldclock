This is a World Clock app for the inPulse watch (http://www.getinpulse.com/).
You will need the inPulse SDK to compile and load it.

Video demo: http://vimeo.com/22541231

Major limitations of the app at this time, that I have no plans to address:
- The watch's local time zone is hard coded. See include/timezone.h
- No handling whatsoever of daylight savings time.
There may be other bugs too; reports (or forks!) are welcome.

The rendering of day and night is fairly realistic according to the current
time and season. The textures come from NASA's "Blue Marble" dataset:

The app depends on a manually 'hacked' resources file and low-level access
to the watch's resource memory to work. This means:
- The resource file resources/inpulse_resources_customized.bin must be loaded.
- It depends on a private API, and may break if that API changes.
- Therefore it probably doesn't work in the inPulse simulator. I haven't tried.
- resource_packer.py is not sufficient to rebuild the resource file.
  When I get a chance (or given sufficient cajoling) I will clean up and
  release the various scripts I used to build the resource file.
